# JVokab2Brain
small and simple-to-use vocabulary training app

## Purpose
First I implemented this piece of software when I was back 
in school and I was not really good in learning the French language.
I liked coding much more, so I decided to build a simple piece 
of software in Visual Basic. Of course, it was more a trial and error
kind of thing than real software development.

Later on, when I lost the original sources, I decided to re-implement
my tool in Java to train my programming skills and try different things
with version control systems and so on. Maybe I'll also use it to 
learn another language someday (or to re-learn French).
